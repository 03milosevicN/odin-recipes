        </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar combined with 1 teaspoon cinnamon (for coating)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the flour until the mixture forms a smooth ball of dough.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil for frying.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a star tip.</li>
        <li>Pipe strips of dough directly into the hot oil, using scissors or a knife to cut the dough. Fry until churros are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried churros from the oil and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>While the churros are still warm, roll them in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon, ensuring an even coating.</li>
    </ol>
    Churros are best enjoyed warm. Serve them on their own or with a side of chocolate or caramel sauce for dipping. Enjoy! :)
