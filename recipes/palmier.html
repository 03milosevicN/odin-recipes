        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <h4>Dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 sheet of puff pastry (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Recommended: 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the puff pastry package.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a clean surface with a layer of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry sheet on the sugared surface</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a generous layer of sugar over the puff pastry. Use a rolling pin to press the sugar into the pastry.</li>
            <li>Fold both sides on the puff pastry towards the center, creating a double fold. Then fold it again, bringing one side over the other.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the folded pastry into 1/2 inch thick pieces.</li>
            <li>Place the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each piece.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the palmiers cookies are golden prown and have caramelized edges.</li>
            <li>Allow the palmiers to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            Serve with either a cup of coffee or tea. Enjoy! :)
